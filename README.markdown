# Foo.app, a demonstration of RestKit with Core Data mapping.


This sample code shows how to utilize RestKit to fetch Twitter public timeline and present them in a table view.

## How To Install

Just clone the repository using this command on Terminal.app:

	cd ~/Desktop
	git clone --recursive git@github.com:taufikobet/Foo.git
	cd Foo

Note: We need to add `--recursive` option because we use RestKit as a submodule.
